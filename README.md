# MemoryGame
Game with Cards
The program is a simple memory game where the player is presented with a 4x4 grid of cards, each hiding a letter. The player makes guesses by selecting two cards, attempting to find matching pairs. If the selected cards match, they remain revealed; if not, the second card is hidden again. The game continues until all pairs are correctly matched, at which point the game is over.
